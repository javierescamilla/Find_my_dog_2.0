        <h2>Stories</h2>
        <p>Through this website we have been able to help people find their dog or the dogs owner. Here are some examples of real life cases</p>
        <h2>Amanda's Case</h2>
        <div class="whoIs" id="amandaCase">
            <img src="./assets/images/stories/amanda.jpg" id="amandaImage"/>
            <p>
                Amanda lost her dog "Precious" on 9/23/2019. She went door to door looking for her, but with no success. However she found out about our application
                and she posted a lost Dog post on our website. Luckyly for her, another user had already found her and as soon he saw her post he contacted her. 
                Since then Amanda and Precious are together again.
            </p>

        <h2>Mariana's case</h2>
        <div class="whoIs" id="marianaCase">
            <img src="./assets/images/stories/mariana.jpg" id="marianaImage"/>
            <p>
                Mariana lost her dog "Chiquita", a small Chihuahua. Due to Chiquita's small size, Mariana was incredibly nervous and desperate to find her, as anything
                could happen to her. So, she went on our website. To her luck somebody had already found her and posted a found Post on our website. Mariana quickly 
                contacted the other user and is now reunited with Chiquita and both are happy.

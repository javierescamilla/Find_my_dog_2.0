                We are two young students, Christian and Javier, who study Engineering in Digital Systems at ITEMS in Monterrey, Mexico. 
                We both love and care about dogs and we are dog owners ourself. As dog owners we know the emotional load and the hassle of losing a dog. 
                It is difficult losing a dog, we have experienced it many times. One never knows where to start or who to ask first. The whole process is stressful and emotionally charged, 
                as the fear of never finding your beloved dog grows steadily. Not to forget this problem is time consuming as you have to go around notifing neighbors, 
                ask them if they have seen him and you have to stroll through the neighborhood, or neighborhoods, looking for him.
            </p>
            <p>
                The problem is not only for the dog owner, but for the person that finds a lost dog. It is time consuming, and is stressful as you don't know where to start as
                you don't have a clue who the owner may be or from where the dog comes from, he even may be from a different neighborhood. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore we think we came up with a useful idea, which is this site. We hope to give a platfomr that facilitates the search for both, the owner and the finder.
                On this website the user has to use less time notifying neighbors as a simple post will do. Also the search time may be shortened as they can quickly look in the feed,
                be it you have found a dog or lost a dog. We hope our small application proves helpful and good luck in your search!

                I'm Christian Bentin a 23 year old student. I currently study at ITESM and hope in one year to be graduated as a Digital Systems Engineer. I have varying hobbies such as robotics,
                video games and walking my dogs.  As said before I am a dog owner, I have a old, small and beautiful Chihuaha named "Chiquita", which literaly translates to small, 
                and a big, clumpsy and beautiful Labrador named "Nala". I love thme both and hope to never loose them. I'm a very optimistic person and always try to see the good in
